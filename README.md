## Acme Explosives Company

Used `Browserify` and `Sass` for compiling purposes. Also, used `Bootstrap`soley for its handy grid system. ~~I used Bower to download Boostrap.~~ To keep things simple (or as simple as possible), Bootstrap's CDN was used.

Please see `package.json` and `Gruntfile` for dev dependencies.

As you can see, I'm also trying to improve my markdown's by using more tools and whatnot. Please forgive me.
